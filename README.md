# React-Redux Notes Application

This is the official repository of the application built with class components in the second part of the Medium article  
_"The only introduction to Redux (and React-Redux) youâ€™ll ever need"_,  
which you can find [here](https://medium.com/@h.stevanoski/the-only-introduction-to-redux-and-react-redux-youll-ever-need-8ce5da9e53c6).

It aims to explain the basic concepts of React-Redux when using class components.  
The hooks branch uses functional components to achieve the same result.  
Check out the article for more information.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
To run the app, simply run  
`npm start`
